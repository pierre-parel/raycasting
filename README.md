# Wolfenstein3D-like Renderer in SDL3

![Screenshot](doc/img.png)

This project implements a basic 2D raycasting engine using SDL3 to render a first-person view of a grid-based world. The engine is inspired by concepts from the [Lodev Raycasting Tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html). It demonstrates raycasting fundamentals, player movement, and real-time frame updates.
